    li Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object&mdash;that final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash&mdash;aye, cash.
    li They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
